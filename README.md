# ArduinoDAC
Project for Electric Circuit Theory ([tek.etf.rs](http://tek.etf.rs/)) class at the University of Belgrade's School of Electrical Engineering

The goal of the project is to create an R-2R ladder DAC, and use an Arduino Mega to generate and output an analog signal, that can be controlled from a computer connected via serial interface.
